In the modern electronics manufacturing industry, quality inspection of Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) is a critical step in ensuring product yield. Traditional manual inspection is inefficient and prone to errors due to visual fatigue. Furthermore, existing Automated Optical Inspection (AOI) equipment, mostly based on traditional image processing algorithms, struggles with low recognition rates for tiny defects in complex backgrounds and lacks adaptability to diverse defect types. To address these issues, this thesis proposes an improved object detection algorithm based on the YOLOv8 architecture to enhance the accuracy and real-time performance of PCB defect detection.

First, this study applies Mosaic data augmentation to address the issue of class imbalance in the PCB dataset. Second, the CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module) attention mechanism is integrated into the backbone network of YOLOv8 to strengthen the feature extraction capability for minute defects. Finally, the EIoU Loss function replaces the original bounding box regression loss to accelerate convergence and improve localization accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5) of 96.5\% on a public PCB defect dataset, representing a 3.2\% improvement over the original YOLOv8 model. Meanwhile, the detection speed reaches 58 Frames Per Second (FPS). This research confirms that the improved algorithm effectively balances detection speed and accuracy, demonstrating significant potential for real-time inspection in industrial assembly lines.
